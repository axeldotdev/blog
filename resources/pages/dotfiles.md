# My Dotfiles

I always have to switch from one computer to another. I have my PC and my Macbook Pro for work and eventualy I will switch when I will leave my current job.

To help me manage all my configuration (ZSH, Git, VS Code, Aliases, etc.) I maintain certain dotfiles on Github and clone the repository on my multiple computers.
